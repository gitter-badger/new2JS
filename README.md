New2JS is an environment for learning JavaScript for those who already know a language. It gives an overview of
its capabilities and also looks at one or two areas that can cause problems.

You can see it in action [here](http://caplin.github.com/new2JS/) and get the source [here](https://github.com/caplin/new2JS/).

It uses [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for nice javascript editing.
